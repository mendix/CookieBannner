# Cookie Cuttr Mendix Widget

##Description
This widget is based on the popular jquery plugin Cookie Cuttr (http://cookiecuttr.com). This widget will allow you to put a cookie banner into your Mendix application. This can be either on a mobile page or desktop. Once the cookies have been accepted then the user will not see the banner again and will be able to proceed as usual. 

##Typical usage scenario
This would most likely be used to comply with the EU cookie law legislations, which came into force in May 2011.
